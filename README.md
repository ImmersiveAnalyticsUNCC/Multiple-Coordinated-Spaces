# Multiple Coordinated Spaces
---------------------------

Multiple Coordinated Views (MCV) has been widely used in visualization.
This work explores Multiple Coordinated Spaces (MCS), a 3D version of MCV, in order to integrate various 2D displays in a large physical environment as a unified analysis workspace.
Built upon the rich background of distributed and embodied cognition, MCS supports interactive analysis in a connected, distributed set of subspaces.

We provide the formalization of MCS and a set of generation, coordination, optimization methods to support interactive analysis in a connected, distributed set of subspaces.
For MCS, we have developed visualization and interactive techniques for coordinating augmented reality devices together with classical WIMP GUIs systems.

In this work, we also demonstrate the power of MCS using a multivariate, geo-spatial biodiversity application.
We have also performed evaluation of how users analyze data using MCS and confirmed positive feedback for integrating physical environments.
The major advantage of MCS is a flexible coordination framework for creating new immersive analytics methods by mixing visualizations from different devices, and mixing physical and virtual operations from different environments.
